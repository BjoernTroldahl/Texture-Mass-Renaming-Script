# Texture-Mass-Renaming-Script
A script meant for mass renaming textures in a specified folder, based on their specified file extension.
But can also be used for any filetype in a folder, that needs mass-renaming, to ensure structure in naming conventions.
Before running the script, make sure that the proper file extension is written in the code and that the folder from your device is written instead of 'your_directory_path'.

## How to use:
1. Download this GitHub repository as a ZIP-file under the Code tab and unzip into a folder.
2. Open the TextureRenaming.py file in your code editor of choice.
3. Replace '.png' in line 8 with the file extension you want the mass renaming to apply to.
4. Replace 'PREFIX_' in line 10 with the prefix that you want to add to the file names with the specified file extensions.
5. Replace 'your_directory_path' in line 17 with the directory path on your PC where you want to perform the mass renaming operation.
6. Run the script and your files will now be renamed.
