# Texture-Mass-Renaming-Script
A script meant for mass renaming textures in a specified folder, based on their specified file extension.
But can also be used for any filetype in a folder, that needs mass-renaming, to ensure naming conventions.
Before running the script, make sure that the proper file extension is written in the code and that the folder from your device is written instead of 'your_directory_path'.
